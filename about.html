<p>Hi, I’m Elleke.</p>

<p>I am passionate about fall colors, the French language, snow, wine, both cooking and savoring amazing dishes and I suffer from what I call “Binge Reading Syndrome”.</p>

<p>I’m 29 years old and I live in Lausanne, Switzerland. Several times I’ve heard that I must be the single Dutch person living in Switzerland that is not tall. Eh…? The other reason I’m subject to laughter is my means of transport: the bike. Rain or no rain, -10 or +35, skirts or pants, I use it.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, I have been working as a consultant for the past three years. My clients were schools and I loved the diversity of the work; listening truly to the problems that made professionals decide to get supported upon, observing, counseling, advising management as well as their teams, and organizing valuable feedback from students to improve the education. I hope to find a position in Switzerland that is just as versatile and challenging as my former position.</p>

<h3 id="the-why-behind-this-blog">The why behind this blog</h3>

<p>I started this blog after having moved from the Netherlands to Lausanne in September 2016 with my love, who accepted a job here.  My challenge is to find an interesting position in this country where my network is still inimini and with a language I do not master fully yet. I figured that I am surely not the only one feeling like this: there are many others who find themselves too in the middle of a job hunting process and all with their own challenges, whether they live abroad or in their home country.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-wisdom">Sharing wisdom</h3>

<p>I am not alone, many people find themselves at a certain point of their lives without a job, or they want to change from profession or position. For some, this process runs smoothly; they know the right people or get hired after their first application. Good for them! For others, the path is a bumpier. Whilst finding yourself on this rugged road does not feel comfortable, I believe you gain a lot of knowledge on what works and what does not in trying to find your next fulfilling destination. I believe in sharing this wisdom to inspire and help others.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>

<p>That is why I decided to create a place for inspirational stories on finding a job, with tips and tricks that don’t come from books but from real people and with a positive perspective.</p>

<p>I hope to inspire both you and myself on our journey!</p>
